<h2>Burger 🍔</h2>

<hr />

<p>
  A hamburger, beefburger or burger is a sandwich consisting of one or more cooked patties of ground meat, usually
  beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried, grilled, or flame broiled. Hamburgers are
  often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, bacon, onion, pickles, or chiles; condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise,
  ketchup, relish, or "special sauce"; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with cheese is
  called a cheeseburger.

  The term "burger" can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the UK where the term "patty" is
  rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. The term may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat
  substitute used, as in "turkey burger", "bison burger", or "veggie burger".

  Hamburgers are sold at fast-food restaurants, diners, and specialty and high-end restaurants (where burgers may sell
  for several times the cost of a fast-food burger, but may be one of the cheaper options on the menu). There are many
  international and regional variations of the hamburger.
